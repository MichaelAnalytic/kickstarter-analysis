Performing analysis on kickstarter data to uncover trends

## Overview of Project
### The Purpose of the project 
Louise would like to know different campaigns fared in relation to their funding goals and their launch date. So, I created two analyses outcomes based on goals, and launch date that Iâ€™ll visualize.
## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
![Therater Outcomes_vs_Launch](https://github.com/MichaelAnalytic/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/Ressources%201/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png)
The month that launch the most Successful Kickstarter campaigns was May. However, February, March, May, November, and December all had roughly the same number of canceled campaigns launched. Also, August, September, June have the same number of canceled campaigns launched.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
![Outcomes_vs_Goal](https://github.com/MichaelAnalytic/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/Ressources%201/Outcomes_vs_Goal.png)
 The goal that launch the most percentage failed Kickstarter campaigns was 100%. However, between those intervals [35000 to 39999] and [40000 to 44999] the successful percentage have the same value. Also, in the same intervals the failed percentage have the same values.The percentage successful and percentage failed are opposed, and percentage cancelled is zero.
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The challenges that I encoutered were to apply countifs formula for each row.
## Results
- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
Outcomes cancelled has nothing in October. Outcomes cuccessful and failed have the same value which is 35 
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
The percentage cancelled is zero. The percentage successful and percentage failed are opposite.
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
We can create Outcomes based on pledged, and ended date.

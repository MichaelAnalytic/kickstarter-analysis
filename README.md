## Overview of Project
### The Purpose of the project 
   
Louise would like to know different campaigns fared in relation to their funding goals and their launch date. So, I created two analyses outcomes based on goals, and launch date that Iâ€™ll visualize.
## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
![Outcomes_vs_Goal]()


    The month that launch the most Successful Kickstarter campaigns was May. However, February, March, May, November, and December all had roughly the same number of canceled campaigns launched. Also, August, September, June have the same number of canceled campaigns launched.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
![Outcomes_vs_Goal](https://github.com/MichaelAnalytic/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/Ressources%201/Outcomes_vs_Goal.png)

   The goal that launch the most percentage failed Kickstarter campaigns was 100%. However, those interval [35000 to 39999] and [40000 to 44999] have the same successful and failed percentage. February all had roughly the same number of canceled campaigns launched. Also, August, September, June has the same number of canceled campaigns launched.
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
## Results
- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
The percentage cancelled is zero. The percentage successful and percentage failed are opposite.
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
We can create pledged tables and graphs
